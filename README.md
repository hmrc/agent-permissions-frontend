Access groups (aka Granular Permissions) is a feature of the Agent Services Account. 
This allows agent firms to control which team members can manage each clientâ€™s tax. 
They do this by creating custom access groups of clients and team members, or tax service groups that allowlist a regime for a list of team members.

Any client that is added to an access group is accessible only by the team members in the group. If a client does not belong to any access group then they would be accessible to all team members.

Each agent must meet an eligibility criteria before they can use access groups. The criteria is the agent must have at least 1 team member and 1 client and no more than a maximum number of clients.

Team members are government gateway accounts created by an Administrator (Admin or User cred role) - so that they share the same groupId for the Agency

### FE Dependencies
The [sortable table](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/sortable-table/) & [multi-select](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/multi-select/) components have been adapted from [MOJ frontend](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/moj-frontend/releases) via importing compiled files - currently using version 1.4.2 (modified, will need updating)

MOJ frontend [requires jQuery](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/get-started/setting-up-javascript/), it is included as a minified file rather than a link to external source due to security issues.


#### Pagination

We have two methods pagination, GET and POST

GET pagination is traditional, a link to the next page
POST pagination is used when we want to persist selections/deselection between pages, and/or search & filter terms.

### Running the tests
